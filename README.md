## üìÇ Output Structure

| Sheet Name       | Description                                  |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `Dashboard`      | Backup summary per movie library             |
| `TV_Dashboard`   | TV shows backup coverage + chart             |
| `Movies`, `Classics`, etc. | One tab per Plex movie library       |
| `TV_Shows`       | Combined list of all TV shows                |
| `Wishlist`       | Pulled live from external Google Sheet       |

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- A Plex Media Server
- A service account with access to the desired Google Sheets
- `.env` file with the following:

```
PLEX_BASEURL=http://localhost:32400
PLEX_TOKEN=your_token_here
IGNORE_LIBRARIES=Music Videos

GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON=google_credentials.json
GOOGLE_SHEET_NAME=Plex Movies
MOVIE_WISHLIST_SHEET=DVD Wish List
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Create your `.env` file
3. Share both Plex Google Sheets (`Plex Movies`, `DVD Wish List`) with your service account email
4. Run:

```bash
python plex_catalog_exporter.py
```

---

## üîÑ Sync Behavior

- Overwrites **each tab** in the Google Sheet matching the Excel sheets
- Extra tabs (e.g., `Notes`) in your Google Sheet are left untouched

---

## üß† Backup Tags Logic

Backup types (e.g., DVD, ISO, Ripped, Blue-ray) are pulled from **Labels**, not Collections, in Plex.

Supported tags:
- `DVD`, `ISO`, `Blue-ray`, `Ripped`, `Backup`

These labels can be added to each movie or episode in Plex, and the script will detect them to classify backups.

## üìã Roadmap

- [x] Replace local Wishlist tab with live data from Google Sheets
- [x] Automatically sync final Excel output to Google Sheets
- [x] Show bar chart of movie backup types

- [x] Add TV Dashboard tab
- [ ] **Add front-end to edit the movie wishlist directly**
- [ ] Add automatic cleanup step to remove timestamped folders (optional)
