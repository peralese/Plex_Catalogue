## ‚úÖ Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- A Plex Media Server
- A service account with access to Google Sheets
- `.env` file with the following:

```env
PLEX_BASEURL=http://localhost:32400
PLEX_TOKEN=your_token_here
IGNORE_LIBRARIES=Music Videos

GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON=google_credentials.json
GOOGLE_SHEET_NAME=Plex Movies
MOVIE_WISHLIST_SHEET=DVD Wish List
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Create your `.env` file
3. Share both Plex Google Sheets (`Plex Movies`, `DVD Wish List`) with your service account email
4. Run the exporter:

```bash
python plex_catalog_exporter.py
```

5. To launch the web UI for editing the DVD Wish List:

```bash
python -m app.app
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000` to view and edit the wishlist.

## üîÑ Sync Behavior

- Overwrites **each tab** in the Google Sheet matching the Excel sheets
- Extra tabs (e.g., `Notes`) in your Google Sheet are left untouched
- The **wishlist** is pulled live from Google Sheets at runtime

---

## üß† Backup Tags Logic

Backup types (`DVD`, `ISO`, `Blue-ray`, `Ripped`, `Backup`) are pulled from the **Labels** field in Plex metadata.

Add these labels to your Plex movies or episodes to track backup types. Multiple labels are supported per item.
